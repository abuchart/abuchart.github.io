			<h2 class='box'>About Me</h2>
			<p>I currently work at a pharmaceutical marketing agency on an account team, marketing HUMIRA. I moved to Chicago for this job, and have lived here for about a year and a half. I love volunteering, and got involved with the Junior League of Chicago last summer!</p>
			<p>I took this class because I want to understand what our developers do, and how they do it. Ultimately, I can communicate more effectively explain our products in laymans terms to our clients.</p>
